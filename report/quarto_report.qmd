## Data Story: Global Trends in Adolescent Health

### 1. Global Overview: Adolescent Health Indicator Map (2022)

![Adolescent Health Indicator Map](../visuals//world_map_2022.png)

The choropleth world map presents a comprehensive view of adolescent health scores by country in 2022. It illustrates substantial disparities across regions:

- High scorers such as Chile, New Zealand, and Australia report adolescent health scores above 50, reflecting strong public health infrastructure, school health programs, and youth-centric social policies.
- Low scorers include several Sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries, where limited healthcare access, economic instability, and sociocultural barriers may hinder adolescent well-being.
- Color gradients offer quick regional contrasts — lighter shades indicate better scores, while darker shades flag critical areas for intervention.

This map highlights the urgent need to address regional inequities in adolescent health, promoting evidence-based policies globally.

This bar chart ranks the top 10 countries in 2022:

- Leading nations include Niue, Cook Islands, and Chile, with scores above 60.
- These are mostly small island states or high-income countries, where focused health delivery and smaller populations may contribute to better outcomes.
- The narrow range among the top 10 reflects limited global outperformance, hinting at a potential ceiling effect or data uniformity.

The bar graph serves as a benchmark and highlights successful models worth exploring and replicating in lower-scoring regions.

This regression scatter plot explores how education levels correlate with adolescent health:

- A clear positive linear trend suggests that countries with higher educational attainment tend to have better adolescent health outcomes.
- The regression line and shaded confidence interval support the strength of this relationship.
- Outliers imply the presence of other influential factors such as healthcare infrastructure, gender norms, and national income.

This visualization underscores the critical link between education and health, promoting integrated development approaches for adolescents.
