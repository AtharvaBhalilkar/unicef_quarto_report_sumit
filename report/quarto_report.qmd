## Data Story: Global Trends in Adolescent Health

### 1. Global Overview: Adolescent Health Indicator Map (2022)

![Adolescent Health Indicator Map](../visuals//world_map_2022.png)

The choropleth world map presents a comprehensive view of adolescent health scores by country in 2022. It illustrates substantial disparities across regions:

- High scorers such as Chile, New Zealand, and Australia report adolescent health scores above 50, reflecting strong public health infrastructure, school health programs, and youth-centric social policies.
- Low scorers include several Sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries, where limited healthcare access, economic instability, and sociocultural barriers may hinder adolescent well-being.
- Color gradients offer quick regional contrasts — lighter shades indicate better scores, while darker shades flag critical areas for intervention.

This map highlights the urgent need to address regional inequities in adolescent health, promoting evidence-based policies globally.

### 2. Line Chart: Health Score Trends Over Time (2000–2022)

![Line Chart - Health Trends](../visuals/line_chart.png)

This time-series line chart visualizes how adolescent health outcomes have evolved across four demographically and geographically diverse countries between 2000 and 2022:

- **Qatar** consistently ranks near the top, maintaining scores close to 100. This suggests sustained investment in public health, education, and infrastructure, benefiting adolescent well-being across decades.

- **New Zealand** shows high but slightly fluctuating scores. While still a strong performer, recent dips may indicate emerging challenges or policy shifts that warrant attention.

- **Peru** displays a volatile trajectory. A strong improvement post-2008 indicates positive policy impact, but inconsistent performance in later years suggests potential setbacks, possibly linked to political instability or uneven resource allocation.

- **Nigeria** trails the group, with health scores below 40 in recent years. This highlights systemic gaps in adolescent healthcare access and socioeconomic disparities that remain unresolved.

Together, these patterns underscore the importance of sustained policy commitment, regional equity, and multi-sector collaboration in improving adolescent health outcomes worldwide.

### 3. Bar Graph: Top 10 Countries by Health Score (2022)

![Bar Graph - Top 10 Countries](../visuals/bar_graph_top10.png)

This bar chart ranks the top 10 countries in 2022:

- Leading nations include Niue, Cook Islands, and Chile, with scores above 60.
- These are mostly small island states or high-income countries, where focused health delivery and smaller populations may contribute to better outcomes.
- The narrow range among the top 10 reflects limited global outperformance, hinting at a potential ceiling effect or data uniformity.

The bar graph serves as a benchmark and highlights successful models worth exploring and replicating in lower-scoring regions.

*Scatter Plot – Sanitation vs. Health*

This regression scatter plot explores how **sanitation access** correlates with adolescent health outcomes:

- A clear positive linear trend suggests that countries with higher access to sanitation facilities tend to report better adolescent health.
- The regression line and shaded confidence band reinforce the strength of this association.
- Outliers suggest additional influencing factors such as income levels, healthcare infrastructure, or cultural practices.

This visualization highlights the importance of investing in basic public health infrastructure like clean water and sanitation to improve adolescent well-being.

### Conclusion

This multi-visual story reveals:

- Persistent global inequalities in adolescent health outcomes.
- The long-term benefits of consistent and well-funded policies.
- The interdependence of sectors, especially education and health.
- The emergence of role-model countries that demonstrate best practices.

These insights guide stakeholders toward data-driven planning, international collaboration, and targeted investments in adolescent well-being.
